# Reviewbooks

The Reviewbooks is a personal project designed to provide an updated version of Yelp's social platform and make it  a more accessible mean of sharing reviews amongst peers. It allows an user to create reviewbooks which contains an assortment of different store locations based on their creative vision for that review book, and it lists their personal ratings for not only the store, but items they've tried as well.

I am building this application with a growing knowledge in the MERN stack: MongoDB, Express, React.js, and Node.js, as well as leveraging the YELP api.
